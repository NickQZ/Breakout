# Breakout Game

This repository contains a classic **Breakout** game implemented entirely in **Java** using **Swing**, developed as part of my **Bachelor of Information Technology** studies through **Open Polytechnic New Zealand**. The game demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, GUI development, and basic game mechanics.

## Game Overview
In **Breakout**, the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball against a wall of bricks. The goal is to destroy all bricks without letting the ball fall off the screen. The game includes:  
- Paddle controlled with **left** and **right arrow keys**  
- Ball with collision detection  
- Multiple rows of bricks  
- Score tracking and lives system  

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **GUI Framework:** Swing (`javax.swing`, `java.awt`)  
- **IDE:** Eclipse

# Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:

Apply object-oriented programming concepts in Java

Build interactive GUI applications using Swing

Implement collision detection and a game loop

Practice debugging and testing interactive software

Developed as part of the Bachelor of Information Technology at Open Polytechnic New Zealand, this project demonstrates practical application of Java programming and Swing-based GUI development.
